  <p>Hi there, thank you for visiting my webpage! I'm a fourth-year undergraduate transfer student at Ashoka University, majoring in Computer Science. Before coming to Ashoka University, I completed two years of foundational education in natural science under the BS-MS program at IISER Kolkata, and later, due to my growing interest in computer science, I joined Ashoka University.</p>

  <p>In Computer Science, my primary interest lies in Computer Networks, Network Security, and the system side of computers, and I'm aiming for a research career in the domain of Network Security.</p>

  <p>Beyond computers, Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the humanities. I have some experience with Hindi writing and enjoy reading and exploring existential philosophy.</p>

  <p>I'm also passionate about teaching. I have taught Science and Mathematics to the students of classes 8-10 at <a href="https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/~ekpehal/pages/aboutUs.html">Ek Pehal, IISER Kolkata</a> and at Neev, the community engagement club of Ashoka University, for some time.</p>

  <p>Apart from these, I often find myself interested in a couple of civic issues, including the degrading freedom of the internet, inadequate privacy and data laws, and global information inequality, and I'm hoping to do something meaningful in these areas in the near future.</p>
